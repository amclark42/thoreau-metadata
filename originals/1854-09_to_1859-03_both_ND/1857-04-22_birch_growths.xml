There are as many of these very regular cones on the white ground of a large birch as there are branches. They are occasioned by the two currents of growth “,” that of the main trunk and that of the branch (which last commenced several inches lower near the centre of the tree) “,” meeting and being rucked or turned up at the line of contact like a surge “,” exposing the edge of the inner bark there “,” decayed and dark “&lt;” while the bark within the lines approaches the darker color of limbs. The larger were six or seven inches high by as much in width at the bottom. You observe the same manner of growth in other tree. That portion of the bark below the limb obeys the influence of the limb and endeavors to circle about it “,” but soon encounters the growth of the main stem. There are interesting figures on the stem of a large white birch “,” arranged spirally about it.”</p><p>PE 12, pg. 334-335 / 2 April-31 July 1857/ NNPM MA 1302:29 / T vol. # XXIII / PDF # XV / JIX </p><p>Location: Cliff Brook</p></body></text></TEI>
