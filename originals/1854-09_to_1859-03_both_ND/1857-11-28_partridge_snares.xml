Upright twigs are stuck in the ground across the path “,” a foot or more in height and just close enough together to turn a partridge aside “,” leaving a space about four inches wide in the middle “,” and some twigs are stretched across above to prevent the birds hopping over. Then a sapling about an inch in diameter or less is bent over “,” and the end caught under one of the twigs which has a notch or projection on one side “,” and a free-running noose “,” attached to the sapling “,” hangs in the opening and is kept spread by being hung on some very slight nicks in the two twigs. This seems to suppose the bird to be going one way only “,” but perhaps if it cannot escape one way it will turn and try to go back “,” and so spring the trap.”</p><p>PE 13, pg. 211 / 25 November 1857-4 June 1858/ NNPM MA 1302:31 / T vol. # XXV / PDF # XVI / JX</p></body></text></TEI>
