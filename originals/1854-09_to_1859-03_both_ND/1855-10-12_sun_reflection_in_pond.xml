His broad sphere extended stretches the whole length of the pond toward me. First “,” in the extreme distance “,” I see a few sparkles of the gold on the dark surface; then begins a regular and solid column of shimmering gold “,” straight as a rule “,” but at one place “,” where a breeze strikes the surface from one side “,” it is remarkably spread or widened “,” then recovers its straightness again “,” thus: [image 1] Again it is remarkable curved “,” say thus: [image 2] then broken into several pieces “,” and entire again “,” then spread or blown aside at the point like smoke from a chimney “,” thus [image 3] Of course “,” if there were eyes enough to occupy all the east shore “,” the whole pond would be seen as one dazzling shimmering lake of melted gold.
