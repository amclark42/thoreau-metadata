We are almost ready to believe that they have been shut up in the earth all the rest of the year because we have not seen their tracks. I see where “,” by the shore of Goose Pond “,” one has pushed up just far enough to open a window through the snow three quarters of an inch across “,” but has noth been forth. Elsewhere “,” when on the pond “,” I see several places where one has made a circuit out on to the pond a rod or more “,” returning to the shore again. Such a track may “,” by what we call accident “,” be preserved for a geological period “,” or be obliterated by the melting of snow.”</p><p>PE 13, pg. 226 / 25 November 1857-4 June 1858/ NNPM MA 1302:31 / T vol. # XXV / PDF # XVI / JX</p></body></text></TEI>
