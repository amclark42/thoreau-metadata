Only a dim twilight struggles through to this lower region “,” and the sight of these snowy walls or labyrinths suggests a rare stillness “,” freedom from win and jar. If you try to stoop and wind your way there “,” you get your neck and ears full of snow. [image] I can’t draw it. That is “,” for each dead pine branch you have a thin flat branch of snow resting on it “,” an exaggeration of the former. It is a still white labyrinth of snowy purity “,” and you can look far into its recesses under the green and snowy canopy “,” –a labyrinth of which “,” perchance “,” a rabbit may have the clue. I noticed one pitch pine about three feet high so snowed up “,” and its branches all drooping “,” it looked like a draped statue or a white-ant hill.”</p><p>PE 14, pg. 389-390/ 9 November 1858-7 April 1859 / NNPM MA 1302:34 / T vol. # XXVIII / PDF # XVII / JXI</p><p>With 04_01_1858_pitch_pines_01-03</p></body></text></TEI>
