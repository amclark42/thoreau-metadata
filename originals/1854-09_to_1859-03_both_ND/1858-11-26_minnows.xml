Have but one dorsal fin and “,” as near as I can count “,” rays “,” dorsal 19 (first “,” 9 stouter and stiff and more distinctly pointed “,” then 10 longer and flexible “,” whole fin about three times as long as average height) “,” caudal 17 “,” anal 13 or 14 “,” ventral 6 “,” pectoral 10 (?). They have about seven transverse dusky bars like a perch (!). Yet “,” from their form and single dorsal fin “,” I think they are bream. Are they not a new species? Have young breams transverse bars? A little narrower than this.”</p><p>PE 14, pg. 346-347/ 9 November 1858-7 April 1859 / NNPM MA 1302:34 / T vol. # XXVIII / PDF # XVII / JXI</p></body></text></TEI>
