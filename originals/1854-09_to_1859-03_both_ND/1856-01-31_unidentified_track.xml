[image] It must be a bird “,” which at last struck the snow with its wings and took flight. There were but four hops in all “,” and then it ended as above “,” though there was nothing near enough for it to hop upon from the snow. The form of the foot was somewhat like that of a squirrel “,” though only the outline was distinguished.
