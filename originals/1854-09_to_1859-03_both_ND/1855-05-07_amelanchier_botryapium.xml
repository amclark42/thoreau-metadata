The long “,” narrow unfolded flower-buds “,” rose-pink without “,” are very pretty with the dark-purplish leaves “,” –prettier than the open ones “,” –like little cigarettes “,” to compare fair with foul. The dark-purple fruit-like fascicles of the staminate flowers of the ash on the rocks are now very remarkable “,” about the size of pignuts “,” and looking somewhat like them against the sky on the perfectly bare tree “,” or like dry alder scales or cones; will shed pollen in a day or two. Oftener one pedicelled anther and stamen than two together in the very minute calyx “,”—if it is one. Young bass from seed an inch high “,” the two leaves remarkably cut.”</p><p>PE 9, pg. 366 / 3 Sept 1854 – 12 May 1855 / NNPM MA 1302:24 / T vol. # XVIII / PDF # XIII</p></body></text></TEI>
