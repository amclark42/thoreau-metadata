Farmer showed me an ermine weasel he caught in a trap three or four weeks ago. They are not very common about his barns. All white but the tip of the tail; two conspicuous canine teeth in each jaw. In summer they are distinguished from the red weasel “,” which is a little smaller “,” by the length of their tails “,” particularly “,”—six or more inches “,” while the red one’s is not two inches long. He says their track is like that of the mink: -- [image] as if they had only two legs. They go on the jump. Sometimes make a third mark.”</p><p>PE 9, pg. 206-207 / 3 Sept 1854 – 12 May 1855 / NNPM MA 1302:24 / T vol. # XVIII / PDF # XIII</p></body></text></TEI>
