The ice was nearly worn through all along there “,” with wave-like regularity “,” in oblong (round end) or thick crescent or kidney shaped holes “,” as if worn by the summits of waves “,” –like a riddle to sift a man through. These holes are hard to detect in some lights except by shaking the water. I saw some cakes of ice “,” ten feet across and one foot thick “,” lodged with one end of the top of a fence-post and some seven or eight feet in the air “,” the other on the bottom.”</p><p>PE 9, pg. 218 / 3 Sept 1854 – 12 May 1855 / NNPM MA 1302:24 / T vol. # XVIII / PDF # XIII</p><p>Location: Nut Meadow Brook</p></body></text></TEI>
