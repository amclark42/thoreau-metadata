I omit to draw the other horizontal grain. The situation of this bubble also suggests that ice perhaps increases more above than below the plane of its first freezing in the course of a winter “,” by the addition of surface water and snow ice.”</p><p>PE 9, pg. 220-221 / 3 Sept 1854 – 12 May 1855 / NNPM MA 1302:24 / T vol. # XVIII / PDF # XIII</p><p>Location: Derby Bridge</p></body></text></TEI>
