It was remarkable that the current and all that it carried with it passed incessantly through and over these lines without in the least disturbing them “,” or rather breaking them “,” only producing that slight undulation. I describe it as it appears.”</p><p>PE 14, pg. 409/ 9 November 1858-7 April 1859 / NNPM MA 1302:34 / T vol. # XXVIII / PDF # XVII / JXI</p></body></text></TEI>
