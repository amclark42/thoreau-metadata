I see thus the outline of the hills eight or ten rods back through the trees. This I can never do in the summer “,” when the leaves are thick and the ground is nearly the same color with them. These white hills are now seen as through a veil of stems. Immediately after the wood was cut off “,” this outline “,” of course “,” was visible at all season “,” but the wood “,” springing up again “,” concealed it “,” and now the snow has come to reveal the lost outline.”</p><p>PE 14, pg. 393/ 9 November 1858-7 April 1859 / NNPM MA 1302:34 / T vol. # XXVIII / PDF # XVII / JXI</p></body></text></TEI>
