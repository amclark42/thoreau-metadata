What a graceful and pleasing outline! a combination of graceful curves and angles. These deep bays in the leaf are agreeable to us as the thought of deep and smooth and secure havens to the mariner. But both your love of repose and your spirit are addressed “,” for both bays and headlands are represented “,” –sharp-pointed rocky capes and rounded bays with smooth strands. To the sailor’s eye it is a much indented shore “,” and in his casual glance he thinks that if he doubles its sharp capes he will find a haven in its deep rounded bays. If I were a drawing-master “,” I would set my pupils to copying these leaves “,” that they might learn to draw firmly and gracefully. It is a shore to the aerial ocean “,” on which the windy surf beats. How different from the white oak leaf with its rounded headlands “,” on which no lighthouse need be placed.”</p><p>PE 14, pg. 314/ 9 July 1858-9 November 1858 / NNPM MA 1302:33 / T vol. # XXVII / PDF # XVII / JXI</p></body></text></TEI>
