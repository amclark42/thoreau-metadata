This “,” at least “,” is an evidence that cold weather is come. Looking closely at it “,” it reminds me by its form and position of the decodon bark half cracked open. It consists of four or five thin curled shavings of frost “,” so to speak horizontally grained “,” placed vertically and based on the stem “,” one within another “,” and curling toward the same side “,” forming a sort of fool’s cap of different thicknesses “,” or cockles “,” or sugar-plums. It seems it is so cool that the frost about the cistus to melt all day “,” in the shade.
