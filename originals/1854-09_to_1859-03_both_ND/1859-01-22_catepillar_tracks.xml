And there were the distinct trails of a great many more which had reached the willows or disappeared elsewhere. These trails were particularly distinct when I squatted low and looked over the ice “,” reflecting more light then. They were generally pretty direct toward the shore “,” or toward any clump of willows if within four or five rods. I saw one which led to the willows from the old ice some six rods off. Slowly as they crawled “,” this journey must have been made within a few hours “,” for undoubtedly this ice was formed since midnight. Many of the lines were very meandering ‘,” like this: -- [ image] and apparently began and ended within the thin ice. There was not enough ice to support even a caterpillar within three or four feet of the shore “,” for the water was still rapidly rising and not now freezing “,” and I noticed no catepillars on the ice within several feet “,” but with a long stick as I obtained quite a number.”</p><p>PE 14, pg. 417-418/ 9 November 1858-7 April 1859 / NNPM MA 1302:34 / T vol. # XXVIII / PDF # XVII / JXI</p></body></text></TEI>
