Hence “,” too “,” we are struck by the prevalence of sky or light in the reflection “,” and at twilight dream that the light has gone down into the bosom of the waters; for in the reflection the sky comes up to the very shore or edge and appears to extend under it “,” while “,” the substance being seen from a elevated point “,” the actual horizon is perhaps many miles distant over the fields and hills. In the reflection you have an infinite number of eyes to see for you and report the aspect of things each from its point of view. The statue in the meadow which actually is seen obscurely against the meadow “,” in the reflection appears dark and distinct against the sky.”</p><p>PE 14, pg. 213-214/ 9 July 1858-9 November 1858 / NNPM MA 1302:33 / T vol. # XXVII / PDF # XVII / JXI</p></body></text></TEI>
