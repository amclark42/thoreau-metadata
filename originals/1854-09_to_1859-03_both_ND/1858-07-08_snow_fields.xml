         <p>“We crossed a narrow portion of the snow, but found it unexpectedly hard and dangerous to traverse. I tore up my nails in my efforts to save myself from sliding down its steep surface. The snow-field now formed an irregular crescent on the steep slope at the head of the ravine, some sixty rods wide horizontally, or from north to south, and twenty-five rods wide from upper to lower side. It may have been a half dozen feet thick in some places, but it diminished sensibly in the rain while we were there. Is said to be all gone commonly by end of August. The surface was hard, difficult to work your heels into, and a perfectly regular steel slope, steeper than an ordinary roof from top to bottom. A considerable stream “” a source of the Saco, was flowing out form beneath it, where it had worn a low arch a rod or more wide. Here were the phenomena of winter and earliest spring, contrasted with summer. On the edge of and beneath the overarching snow, many plants were just pushing up as in our spring. The great plaited elliptical buds of the hellebore had just pushed up there, even under the edge of the snow, and also bluets.”</p>
