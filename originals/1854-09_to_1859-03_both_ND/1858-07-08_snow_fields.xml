I tore up my nails in my efforts to save myself from sliding down its steep surface. The snow-field now formed an irregular crescent on the steep slope at the head of the ravine “,” some sixty rods wide horizontally “,” or from north to south “,” and twenty-five rods wide from upper to lower side. It may have been a half dozen feet thick in some places “,” but it diminished sensibly in the rain while we were there. Is said to be all gone commonly by end of August.
