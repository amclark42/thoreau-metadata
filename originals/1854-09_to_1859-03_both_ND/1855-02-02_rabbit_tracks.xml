In the case of the rabbit the fore feet are further apart than the hind ones “,” the first say four or five inches to the outside “,” the last two or three. They are generally not quite regular “,” but one of the fore feet a little in advance of the other “,” and so with one of the hind feet. There is an interval of about sixteen inches between each four tracks. Sometimes they are in a curve or crescent “,” [image] all touching.”</p><p>PE 9, pg. 163 / 3 Sept 1854- 12 May 1855 / NNPM MA 1302:24 / T vol. # XVIII / PDF # XIII</p></body></text></TEI>
