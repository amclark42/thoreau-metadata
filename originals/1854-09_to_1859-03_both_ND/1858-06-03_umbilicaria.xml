It was the steepest and most exposed parts of the high rocks alone on which they grew “,” where you would think it most difficult for them to cling. They also covered the more rounded brows on the sides of the mountain “,” especially the east side “,” where they were very dense “,” fine “,” crisp “,” and firm “,” like a sort of shagreen “,” giving a firm footing or hold to the feet where it was needed. It was these that gave that Ararat-brown color of antiquity to these portions of the mountain “,” which a few miles distant could not be accounted for compared wth the more prevalent gray.</p></body></text></TEI>
