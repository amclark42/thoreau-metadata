They accompanying coarse sketch will give a <hi rend="italic">general</hi> idea of it. There were thirteen distinct rings about each centre “,” before they united and one rig inclosed both.  Then there was a piece of bark “,”—which may be rudely represented by the upper black mark “,” –say six or eight inches long. This was not overgrown but by the twenty-fourth ring. These two centres of growth corresponded in position to the two main branches six feet above “,” and I inferred that when the tree was about eighteen years old “,” the fork commenced at nine and a half feet from the ground “,” but as it increased in diameter “,” it united higher and higher up. I remember that the bark was considerably nearer one centre than the other. There was bark in several places completely overgrown and included on the extreme butt end where cut off “,” having apparently overgrown its own furrow.”</p><p>PE 10, pg. 143 / 4 January-23 April 1856 / NNPM MA 1302:26 / T vol. # XX / PDF # XIV / JVIII</p></body></text></TEI>
