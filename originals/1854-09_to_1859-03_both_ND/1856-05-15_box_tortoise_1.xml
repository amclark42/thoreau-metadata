The fifth and sixth marginal plates do not project by their edges beyond the shell. The yellow marks are much narrower “,” and more interrupted and like Oriental characters “,” than the Cape Cod one. The sternum also is less oval “,” uniformly blackish-brown except a few slight bone- or horn-colored blotches “,” while the Cape Cod one is light-yellow with a few brown blotches. The scales of the sternum in this are much less sharp-angled than in the Cape Cod one.
