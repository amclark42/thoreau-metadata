It was sunning on the bank and would face me and dart its head toward me when I tried to drive it from the water. It is barred above “,” but indistinctly when out of water “,” so that it then appears almost uniformly dark-brown “,” but in the water broad reddish-brown bars are seen “,” very distinctly alternating with very dark brown ones. The head was very flat and suddenly broader than the neck behind. Beneath it was whitish and reddish flesh-color. It was about two inches in diameter at the thickest part. They are the biggest and most formidable-looking snakes that we have. The inside of its mouth and throat was pink. It was awful to see it wind along the bottom of the ditch at last “,” raising wreaths of mud “,” amid the tadpoles “,” to which it must be a very sea-serpent.”</p><p>PE 13, pg. 416 / 25 November 1857-4 June 1858/ NNPM MA 1302:31 / T vol. # XXV / PDF # XVI / JX</p></body></text></TEI>
