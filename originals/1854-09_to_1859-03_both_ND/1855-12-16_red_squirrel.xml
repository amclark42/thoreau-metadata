They are remarkably tame. One sits tirling apparently a dried apple in his paws “,” with his tail curled close over his back as if to keep it warm “,” fitting its curve. How much smothered sunlight in their wholesome brown red this misty day! It is clear New England “,” Nov-anglia “,”like the red subsoil. It is springlike.”</p><p>PE 10, pg. 51 / 13 May 1855-3 January 1856 / NNPM MA 1302:25 / T vol. # XIX / PDF # XIV / JVII &amp; JVIII</p></body></text></TEI>
