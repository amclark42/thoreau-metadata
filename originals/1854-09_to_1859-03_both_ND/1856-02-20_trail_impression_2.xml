         <p>“On level ground its trail had this appearance: [image] Commonly seven to nine or ten inches wide, and tracks of feet twenty to twenty-four apart; but sometimes there was no track of the feet for twenty-five feet, frequently for six; in the last case <hi rend="italic">swelled</hi> in the outline, as above. Having come down as far as opposite the great white on the hill, it returned on its track and entered a hole under the ice at Assabet Spring, from which it has not issues.”</p>
