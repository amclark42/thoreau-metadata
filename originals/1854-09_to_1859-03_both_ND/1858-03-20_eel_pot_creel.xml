It was an eel-pot or creel “&lt;’ a wattled basket or wicker-work “,” made of willow osiers with the bark on “,” very artfully. It was about four feet long and shaped thus: [image]. Moore says that he used to find them in the brooks when he was trout-fishing “,” stopping them up so closely with sticks and stones on the sides that not a trout could pass “,” and he way cut them from end to end with his knife. About a dozen (or more_ willow sticks “,” as big one’s finger or larger “,” being set small end down in a circle “,” in a thin round board which made the bottom “,” and then smaller osiers interwoven at right angles with them “,” close and firm. Another funnel-shaped basket was secured with this “,” extending about half-way down it “,” as represented by the dotted lines “,” with an opening hardly two inches wide at the bottom “,” where only a dozen sharped sticks approached each other. There was a square door in the board bottom “,” by which the fishes could be taken out. This was set in that sluiceway “,” with the mouth or broad end down-stream “,” all sunk beneath the surface “,” the fishes being now evidently running up the brooks from the rivers and ponds “,” the ice being mostly gone out of the meadows and brooks.”</p><p>PE 13, pg. 312-313 / 25 November 1857-4 June 1858/ NNPM MA 1302:31 / T vol. # XXV / PDF # XVI / JX</p></body></text></TEI>
