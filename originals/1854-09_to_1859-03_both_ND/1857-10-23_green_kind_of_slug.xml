It can elongate itself and also run out its head a little from beneath this soft kind of shell. Beneath “,” quite flat and fleshy-ribbed. Climbs up glass slowly but easily. Reminds me of a green beechnut “,” but flat-backed. Would hardly suspect it to have life at first sight. Sticks very firmly to the bark of glass; hard to be pushed aside.”</p><p>PE 12, pg. 118 / 31 July-25 November 1857/ NNPM MA 1302:30 / T vol. # XXIV / PDF # XVI / JIX &amp; JX</p></body></text></TEI>
