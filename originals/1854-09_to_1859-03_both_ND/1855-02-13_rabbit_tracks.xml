The earliest “,” made while the snow was very soft “,” were very large and shapeless “,” somewhat like the marks made by snow falling from the trees.

The distinct track was like this: [image] the front tracks “,” which are largest “,” being about two and a half inches in diameter “,” and the whole track of the four feet often one foot long.
