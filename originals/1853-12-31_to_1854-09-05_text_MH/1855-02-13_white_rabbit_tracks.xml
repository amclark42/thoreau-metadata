The earliest, made while the snow was very soft, were very large and shapeless, somewhat like the marks made by snow falling from the trees. More recent ones had settled and broken the slight crust around them, leaving a large indentation. The distinct track was like this: the front tracks, which are the largest, being about two and a half inches in diameter, and the whole track of the four feet often one foot long. These impressions so slight (though distinct) it is hard to realize that so heavy an animal made them.”</p></body></text></TEI>
