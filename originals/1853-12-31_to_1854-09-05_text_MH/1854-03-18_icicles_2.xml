Before looking this way we had seen the whitened shore from the Lupine Hill. It is blown 7 dashes against the willows and incrusts them with ice sometimes to the height of 3 feet- with icicles shaped like bulls-horns- especially observable where many osiers stand together and from the more horizontal osiers &amp;c depend icicles 5 or 6 inches long very regularly looking exactly like coarse rakes- apparently not the result of melting but of the spray &amp; water blown or dashed upon them. Only more regular. A very wintry sight.”</p></body></text></TEI>
