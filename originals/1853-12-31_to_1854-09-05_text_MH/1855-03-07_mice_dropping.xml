         <p>“Saw, about a hemlock stump on the hillside north of the largest Andromeda Pond, very abundant droppings of some kind of mice, on that common green moss (forming a firm bed about an inch high, like little pines, surmounted by a fine re dstem with a green point, in all three quarters of an inch high), which they had fed on to a great extent, evidently when it was covered with snow, shearing it off level. Their droppings could be collected by the hand probably, a light brown above, green next the earth. They were apparently many of their holes in the earth about the stump. They must have fed very extensively on this moss the past winter.”</p>
