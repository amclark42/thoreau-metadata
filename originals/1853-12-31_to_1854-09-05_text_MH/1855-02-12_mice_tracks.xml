I saw where they had run over the snow, making a slight impression, thus: the tracks some five inches apart, frequently with a very distinct mark of the tail. These tracks commonly came together soon and made one beaten trail where two or three had passed, or one several times; as if they had hopped along, two, three, or four in company. The whole trail would be five or six inches wide.”</p></body></text></TEI>
