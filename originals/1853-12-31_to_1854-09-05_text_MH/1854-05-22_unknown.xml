Rubus sempervirence put for leaf soon after R. Canadensis Is that the O. Cinnamomea? at the dwarf sumachs (which ap flowers with the Hill one) its fertil fronds without leaves &amp; its curved white rfoots or bases regularly feather marked? The Dwarf sumach is just starting, some of them, decidedly later than the button bush! At Clam shell- the small oblong yellow heads of yel. clover- some days. Tall butter-cup a day or 2 – Dandelions for some time gone to seed. Water saxifrage now well out.
