Farmer showed me an ermine weasel he caught in a trap three or four weeks ago. They are not very common about his barns. All white but the tip of the tail; two conspicuous canine teeth in each jaw, In summer they are distinguished from the red weasel, which is a little smaller, by the length of their tails, particularly, -six or more inches, while the red one’s is not two inches long. He says their tracks are like that of the mink:- as if they had only two legs. They go on the jump. Sometimes make a third mark.”</p></body></text></TEI>
