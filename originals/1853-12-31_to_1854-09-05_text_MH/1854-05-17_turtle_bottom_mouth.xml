         <p>“The turtle was very sluggish though capable of putting forth great strength, He would just squeeze into a flout barrel- &amp; would not quite lie flat in it when his head &amp; tail were drawn in- There was a triangular place on the bottom of his mouth- &amp; an orifice within it through which apparently he breathed. The orifice opening &amp; shutting. I hear of a man who ingured his back seriously for many years by carrying one some distance at arms length to prevent his biting him. They are frequently seen fighting &amp; their shells heard striking together.”</p>
