It is slende- somewhat small vireo like bird- yellow &amp; yellowish all beneath- except a chesnutish (?) crescent on breast- with ap. a white spot on the wing- an certainly a yellow or greenish yellow back between wings. Keeping rather high in the trees- I could not see the general color of the upper-parts but thought it was dark olivaceous or maybe slaty. Can it be the blue-yellow-back warbler?</p></body></text></TEI>
