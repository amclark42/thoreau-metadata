There is in the middle an open pool 20 or 30 feet in diameter nearly full of sphagnum &amp; green froth on the surface (frog-spittle) and what other plants I could not see on account of the danger in standing on the quaking ground. Then a dense border a rod or more wide of a peculiar rush (?) with clusters of seed vessels 3 together now going to seed a yel. green –forming an abrupt edge next the water this one dense bed of quaking sphagnum- in which I sink 18 inches in water upheld by its matted roots where I fear to break through- On this the spatulate sundew abounds. This is marked by the paths of muskrats.</p><p>	Next comes half a dozen rods wide a dense bed of Andromeda Calyculata The A. polifolia mingled with it- the rusty cotton grass-cranberries the common &amp; also V. Oxycoccus-pitcher plants- sedge 7 a few young speuce &amp; larch here &amp; there – All on sphagnum –which forms little hillocks about the stems of the Andromeda.”</p></body></text></TEI>
