These great organ pipes are formed where the water flows over triangular projections of the rocks- The perpendicularity of the icicles contrasts strangely with the various angles of the rocks. Its is now quite cold &amp; in many places only a sharp spear of purest crystal which does not reach the rock below is left to tell of the water that has flowed here- These solid pipe-like icicles comonly unite by there sides &amp; form rows of pillars or irregular colonades run together betwen which here &amp; there you can insert your hand-revealing a peculiar internal structure, as of successive great drops. Thus behind these perpendicular pipes or congregated pillars or colonades run together are formed the prettiest little aisles or triangular alcoves with lichen-clad sides.”</p></body></text></TEI>
