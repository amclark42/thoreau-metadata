         <p>“Its trail, about six inches wide and of furrows in the snow, was on one side of its foot-tracks, thus: and there was about nine inches between the fore and hind feet [sic]. Close by the Great Aspen I saw were it had entered or come out of the water under a shelf of ice left adhering to a maple. There it apparently played and slid on the level ice, making a broad trail as if a shovel had been shoved along, just eight inches wide, without a foot-track in it for four feet or more.”</p>
