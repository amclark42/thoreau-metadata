The creeping juniper appears to be now just in bloom- I see only the female flower- I sail back with a fair SW wind- The water is strewn with myriads of wrecked shad-flies erect on the surface- with their wings up like so many schooners all headed one way. What an abundance of food they must afford to the fishes- Now &amp; then they try to fly &amp; fall on the water again. They ap. reach from one end of the river to the other 1 to a square yard or 2. The scleranthus is out XX &amp; a tuft of that brownish flowered kind of sedge.”</p></body></text></TEI>
