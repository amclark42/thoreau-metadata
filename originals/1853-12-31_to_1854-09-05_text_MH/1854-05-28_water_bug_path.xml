It took but about a minute. It was an interesting sight- proving that this little insect whose eyes are hardly raised above the plane of the water sees, or is cognizant of, the opposite shore. I have no doubt that they cross with ease &amp; rapidity lakes a mile wide. It looked like an adventurous voyage for it. Probably he is in danger from fishy- monsters- though it must be difficult for a fish to catch one.”</p></body></text></TEI>
