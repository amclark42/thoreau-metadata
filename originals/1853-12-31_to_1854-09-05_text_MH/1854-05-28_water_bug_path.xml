         <p>“At the <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">old </hi>bridge at the hill- the water being quite smooth I saw a water bug cross straight from the S to the N. side- about 6 rods furrowing the water in a waving line there being no other insects near him on the surface. It took but about a minute. It was an interesting sight- proving that this little insect whose eyes are hardly raised above the plane of the water sees, or is cognizant of, the opposite shore. I have no doubt that they cross with ease &amp; rapidity lakes a mile wide. It looked like an adventurous voyage for it. Probably he is in danger from fishy- monsters- though it must be difficult for a fish to catch one.”</p>
