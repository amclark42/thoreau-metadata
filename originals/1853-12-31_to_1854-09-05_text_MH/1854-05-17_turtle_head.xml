         <p>“He had a very ugly &amp; spiteful face ( with a vigilant grey eye- which was never shut in any position of the head) surrounded by the thick &amp; ample folds of skin about his neck- His shell was comparatively smooth &amp; free from moss a dirty black- He was a dirty or speckled white beneath. He made the most remarkable &amp; awkward appearance when walking. The edge of his shell was lifted about 8 inches from the groun –tilting now to this side then to that –his great scaly legs or flippers hanging with flesh &amp; loose skin- slowly &amp; gravely hissing the while. His walking was perfectly elephantine. Thus he stalked along a low conical mountain- dragging his tail with his head turned upwards with the ugliest &amp; most venomous look0 0on his flippers half-leg half fin. But he didn’t proceed far before he sank down to rest- If he could support a world on his back when lying down he certainly could not stand up under it.”</p>
