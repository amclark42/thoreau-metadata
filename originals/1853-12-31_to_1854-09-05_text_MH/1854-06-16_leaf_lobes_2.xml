I observed yesterday that the vib. Dentatum was very conspicuous &amp; prevalent along the river- as if few other flowers were in bloom- An abundance of galium trifidum in low grounds some smooth- some rough- with 4 leaves or 5 or 6- I do not distinguish the carieties.- Am in doubt whether the Polygonum which I find just opening at the ditch (say tomorrow) is –sagittatum a rank one- (or <hi rend="italic">arifolium</hi> – the lobes of the leaves do not spread thus but are 3 or 4 styles &amp; 4 or 5 angled pods- Epilobium prob. Coloratum- yet rather downy-to-morrow- It is worth the while to see the rank weeds which grow here on this cleared &amp; ditched swamp.”</p></body></text></TEI>
