I see that the ice in hollows in the fields breaks up (partially) in the same manner with that on the river- viz. around the shore it is covered with water &amp; rests on the bottom- while the middle is raised with the water- &amp; hence a ridge is heaved up where the 2 ices meet. I am not certain how far this overflowing of the ice next the shore- or on the meadows may be owing to the flood from the hills in the first instance running over then under it &amp; keeping it down- as well as to its adhesion to the bottom.”</p></body></text></TEI>
