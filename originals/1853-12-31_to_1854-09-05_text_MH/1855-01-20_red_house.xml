Thought he should send Mr. Upjohn to see it. The whole house, methought, was well planted, rested solidly on the earth, with its great bank (green in summer) and few stately elms before it [was] so much simpler and more attractive than a front yard with its knickknacks. To contrast with this pleasing structure, which is painted a whole-some red, was a modern addition in the rear, perhaps no uglier than usual, only by contrast, -such an outline alone as our carpenters have learned to produce. I see that I cannot draw anything so bad as the reality. So you will often see an ufly new barn beside a pleasing old house.”</p></body></text></TEI>
