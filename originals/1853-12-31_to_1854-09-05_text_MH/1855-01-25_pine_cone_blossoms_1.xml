They begin to open about half-way up. They are exceedingly regular and handsome: the scales with shallow triangular or crescent-shaped extremities, the prickly pointing downward, are most open above, and are so much recurved at the base of the cone that they lie close together and almost flat there, or at angles with the stem, like a shield of iron scales, making a perfectly regular figure of thirteen (in one instance) curved rays, thus: -only far more regular.”</p></body></text></TEI>
