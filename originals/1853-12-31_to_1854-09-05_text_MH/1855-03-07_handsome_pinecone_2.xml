It is a very rich and wholesome brown colo, of various shades as you turn it in your hand, -a light ashy or gray brown, somewhat like unpainted wood, as you look down on it, or as if the lighter brown were covered with a gray lichen, seeing only those parts of the scales always exposed, -with a few darker streaks or marks and a drop of pitch at the point of each scale. Within, the scales are a dark brown above (i.e. as it hangs) and a light brown beneath, very distinctly being marked beneath by the same darker brown, down the centre and near the apex somewhat anchorwise.”</p></body></text></TEI>
