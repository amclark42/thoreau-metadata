         <p>“I see, in the thin snow along by the button-bushes and willows just this side of the Hubbard bridge, a new track to me, looking even somewhat as if made by a row of large rain-drops, but it is the track of some small animal. The separate tracks are at most five eighths of an inch in diameter, nearly round, an done and three quarters to two inches apart, varying perhaps half an inch form a straight line, thus: [image] Sometimes they are three or four inches apart. The size is but little larger than that of a mouse, but it is never thus, or like a mouse. Goodwin, to whom I described it, did not know what it could be.”</p>
