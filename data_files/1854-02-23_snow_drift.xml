         <p>“Pm	Saw some of those architectural drifts froming. The fine snow came driving along over the field like steam curling from a roof- As the current rises to go over the wall it produces a lull in the angle made by the wall &amp; ground &amp; accordingly just enough snow is deposited there to fill the triangular calm but the greatest part passes over &amp; is deposited in the longer calm- A portion of the wind also apparently passes through the chinks of the wall- &amp; curves upward against the main drift- appearing to carve it &amp; perforate it in various fashions holding many snowy particles in suspension- in vertical eddies. I am not sure to what extent the drift is carved &amp; perforated- &amp; to what originally in deposited in these forms.“</p>
