         <p>“The bottom of its chamber was barely raised above the water &amp; the roof was hung with icicles. The sun being low I see as I skate reflected from the surface of the ice flakes of rain bow somewhat like cobwebs where the great slopes of the crystalization fall at the right angle-six inches or a foot across- but at so small an angle with the horizon that they had seem absolutely flat &amp; level before. Think of this kind of mosaic &amp; tessellation for your floor. A floor made up of surfaces not absolutely level-(though level to the touch of the feet &amp; to the noon day eye-(composed of crystals variously set) but just enough inclined to reflect the colors of the rain-bow when the sun gets low. See where a muskrat yesterday brought up clams through a hole in the ice over the middle of the river &amp; left their great violet tinted shells on the edge of the ice- Sometimes break the hinge.”</p>
