         <p>“Just beyond the Bathing place I see the wreck of an ice fleet which yesterday morning must have been very handsome- It reminds me of a vast &amp; crowded fleet of sloops with large slanting sails all standing to the north- These sails are some of them the largest specimens of leaf-structure in ice that I have seen 8 or 9 inches long. Perhaps this structure is more apparent now they have been wasted so much- Their bases can be seen continuing quite through the level ice which has formed about them- as if the wind &amp; waves breaking up a thin ice had held it in that position while it froze in.”</p>
