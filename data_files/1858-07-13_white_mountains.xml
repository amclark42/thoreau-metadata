         <p>“It was the grandest mountain view I ever got. In the meanwhile, white clouds were gathering again about the summits, first about the highest, appearing to form there, but sometimes to send off an emissary to initiate a cloud upon a neighboring peak. You could tell little about the comparative distance of a cloud and a peak till you saw that the former actually impinged on the latter. First Washington, then Adams, then Jefferson put on their caps, and you saw the latter, as it were, send off one small nucleus to gather round the head of Madison.</p>
         <p>This was the best point from which to observe these effects that we <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> in our journey, but it appeared to me that from a hill a few miles further westward, perhaps in Whitefield, the view might be even finer. I made the accompanying two sketches of the mountain outline here, as far south only as what the landlord called Mt. Pleasant, the route from the Notch house being visible no further.”</p>
