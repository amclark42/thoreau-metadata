         <p>“We never cease to be surprised when we observe how swiftly the skater glides along. Just compare him with one walking or running. They walker is but a snail in comparison, and the runner gives up the contest after a few rods. The skater can afford to follow all the windings of a stream, and yet soon leaves far behind and out of sight the walker who cuts across. Distance is hardly an obstacle to him. I observe that my ordinary track is like this: [image] the strokes being seven to ten feet long. The new stroke is eighteen or twenty inches to one side of the old. The briskest walkers appears to be stationary to the skater. The skater has wings, <hi rend="italic">talaria</hi>, to his feet. Moreovere, you have such perfect control of your feet that you can take advantage of the narrowest and most winding and sloping bridge of ice in order to pass between the buttonbushes and the open stream or under a bridge on a narrow shelf, where the walker cannot go at all. You can glide securely within an inch of destruction on this the most slippery of surfaces, more securely than you could walk there, perhaps, on any other material. You can pursue swiftly the most intricate and winding path, even leaping obstacles which suddenly present themselves.”</p>
