         <p>“You can tell by the ridges of the drifts on the south side of the walls which way the wind was. They all run from north to south; i.e., the common drift is divided into ridges or plaits in this direction, frequently down to the ground between; which separate drifts are of graceful out-lines somewhat like fishes, with a sharp ridge or fin gracefully curved, both as yo ulook from one side and down on them, their sides curving like waves about to break. The thin edge of some of these drifts at the wall end, where the air has come through the wall and made an ddy, are remarkably curved, like some shells, even thus, more than once round: I would not have believed it” </p>
