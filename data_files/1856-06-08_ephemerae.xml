         <p>“…I noticed a great flight of ephemerae over the water, though not so great as that. The greater part were flying down-stream against the wind, but if you watched one long enough you would see him suddenly turn at length and fly swiftly back up the stream. They advanced against the wind faster than I floated along. They were not coupled nor coupling, –I only noticed two coupled, –but flew, most of them, with their bodies curved, thus: [image] or more, and from time to time each one descended to the water and touched it, or rested on it a second or two, sometimes several minutes.”</p>
