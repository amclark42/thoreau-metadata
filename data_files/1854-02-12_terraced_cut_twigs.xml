         <p>“I was surprised to find that these sticks both green &amp; dead had the greater part of them been gnawed off by the rat (&amp; some were nearly half an inch in diameter-) They were cut off not at a right angle with a smooth cut but by successive cuts across at the same time bending the twig down-which produced a sloping &amp; so to speak terraced surface I did not know before that they resembled the beaver in this respect also.”</p>
