         <p>“They [puffballs] are low Oriental domes or mosques. Sometimes crowded together in nests, like a collection of humble cottages on the morr, in the coal-pit or Numidian style; for there is suggested some humble hearth beneath from which this smoke comes up, as it were the homes of slugs and crickets. They please me not a little by their resemblance to rude dome-shaped, turf-built cottages on the plain, wherein some humble but everlasting life is lived. Amid the low and withering grass or the stubble there they are gathered, and their smoke ascends between the legs of the herds and the traveller. I imagine a hearth and pot, and some snug but humble family passing its Sunday evening beneath each one. Some, when you press them harder, emit clear water—the relics of rain or dew—along with the dust, which last, however, has no affinity for it, but is quite dry and smoke-like.”</p>
