         <p>“I discover that I. Dugan found the eggs of my snapping turtle of June 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> ap- the same day. It did not go to a new place then after all- I opened the nest today- It is perhaps 5 or 6 rods from the brook- in the sand near its edge. The surface had been disturbed over a foot &amp; a half in diameter- &amp; was <hi rend="italic">slightly</hi> concave. The nest commenced 5 inches beneath &amp; at its neck was 2 ½ inches across &amp; from this nearly 4 inches deep- &amp; swelled out below to 4 inches in width. –Shaped like a short rounded bottle with a broad mouth- &amp; the surrounding sand was quite firm. I took out 42 eggs closely packed –an Dugan says he had previously broken one which made 43. Daniel Foster says he found 42 this summer in a nest in his field in Princeton. They are a dirty white &amp; spherical a little more than 1 &amp; 1/16 of an inch in diameter- soft shelld so that my finger left a permanent dimple in them.”</p>
