         <p>“This more dazzling white must be due to the higher sun. I see some thick cakes of ice where an ice-car has broken up. In one I detect a large bubble four inches in diameter about a foot beneath the upper surface and six inches from the lower. In confirmation of my theory, the grain of the ice, as indicated by the linear bubbles within it, was converging beneath this bubble, as the rays of light under a burning-glass, and what was the under surface at that time was melted in a concave manner to within one and a half inches of the bubble, as appeared by the curvature in the horizontal grain of the more recently formed ice beneath. I omit to draw the other horizontal grain. The situation of this bubble also suggests that ice perhaps increases more above than below the plane of its first freezing in the course of a winter, by the addition of surface water and snow ice.”</p>
